# task-picker
A little utility I made for myself, in python.

Currently assumes that the items and data repositories are relative to where it is running. This may be changed in the future to allow configuring.
It doesn't need any system directories, so it can remain OS-independent without me having to write special cases.

The "howto" file gives a short description of how to use.
